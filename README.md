# Django Full-stack course

---

Here I included my materials from Django course by Jose Portilla from Udemy.com. Check this course out since it great to understand things like front-end with html, css or back-end with Django, as well as many more.

I did not include materials prepared by Jose, since they are large and I don't own any rights to them.

My materials are organized into multiple sections:

* HTML level 1
* HTML level 2
